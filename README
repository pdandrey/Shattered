Shattered, A Fantasy RPG

Copyright 2012, Dave Andrey

Shattered started out as an HTML5 game entry for the Liberated Pixel Cup (http://lpc.opengameart.org/). However,
due to outside issues I didn't get it near enough to complete to submit. Since then I have picked it back up
and I feel that it is coming together much nicer now. I stumbled upon Neverwell Moor by Jason Oster
(http://blog.kodewerx.org/). The stuff he did with Chipmunk is amazing and pretty much blew away my attempts at
creating additional collision tile types. I have integrated his Chipmunk code into Shattered and pretty much
started over. I am hoping that the end result is cleaner. I know the movement feels a less frustrating with
chipmunk.
